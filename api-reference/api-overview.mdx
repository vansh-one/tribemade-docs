## Introduction

**TribeMade** is a zero-cost e-commerce platform that lets you launch your online store in minutes. Unlike traditional platforms that charge monthly fees ($29-$299), TribeMade is completely free to start - we only take a flat 10% fee on successful deliveries, which includes hosting, domain, payment gateway, and **full API access**.

### API at No Extra Cost

Every TribeMade store comes with complete API access at no additional charge. Whether you're on your first sale or your thousandth, you get:

- **Full REST API** - Create, update, delete products; manage orders programmatically
- **Real-time Webhooks** - Get instant notifications when orders are placed
- **No API Fees** - API access is included in our 10% flat fee (no usage limits)
- **Complete Control** - Automate everything from inventory to order fulfillment

This is especially powerful compared to Shopify, where API access and webhooks come with their $29-$299/month plans.

## TribeMade API Capabilities

TribeMade API provides a comprehensive REST API for managing your e-commerce store programmatically. Build powerful integrations, automate workflows, and create custom solutions.

## Base URL

```
https://api.tribemade.in
```

All API requests must use this base URL.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Environment Variables

Never hardcode API keys:

```python
import os
api_key = os.environ.get('TRIBEMADE_API_KEY')
```

### 2. Use Webhooks, Not Polling

**❌ Don't poll for new orders:**
```python
while True:
    check_for_orders()  # Wastes API calls
    time.sleep(60)
```

**✅ Use webhooks:**
```python
@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def handle_order():
    process_order(request.json)
    return '', 200
```

### 3. Respect Rate Limits

- Implement exponential backoff
- Monitor `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header
- Space out bulk operations
- Handle 429 errors gracefully

### 4. Handle Errors Properly

- Check HTTP status codes
- Parse error messages
- Implement retry logic for 500 errors
- Don't retry 400/401/403/404 errors

### 5. Validate Before Sending

- Check field lengths
- Validate data types
- Ensure categories exist
- Compress images to ≤ 5MB
