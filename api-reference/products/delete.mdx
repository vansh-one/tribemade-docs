</Warning>

<Info>
  **Rate Limit:** 10 requests per minute (intentionally limited for safety)
</Info>

## Endpoint

```
DELETE https://api.tribemade.in/api/products/{product_id}
```

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="product_id" type="string" required>
  UUID of the product to delete
</ParamField>

## Authentication

<ParamField header="X-API-Key" type="string" required>
  Your TribeMade API key (format: `tb-xxxx-xxx-xxxx`)
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">

</ResponseField>

## Deletion Rules

### ✅ CAN Delete

Products with no orders or only completed/cancelled orders:

- Products with **no orders at all**
- Products with only **completed** orders (delivered)
- Products with only **cancelled** orders
- Products with mix of completed/cancelled orders

### ❌ CANNOT Delete

Products with active orders:

- Products with **started** orders (payment received)
- Products with **processing** orders (being prepared)
- Products with **dispatched** orders (shipped)

<Note>
  This prevents breaking order fulfillment. Wait for active orders to complete or cancel them first.
</Note>

## Examples

### Basic Delete

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X DELETE https://api.tribemade.in/api/products/660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440123 \
  -H "X-API-Key: tb-a1b2-c3d-e4f5"
```

```python Python
import requests

product_id = "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440123"
url = f"https://api.tribemade.in/api/products/{product_id}"
headers = {
    "X-API-Key": "tb-a1b2-c3d-e4f5"
}

response = requests.delete(url, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
# Output: {"message": "Product deleted successfully"}
```

```javascript Node.js
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

const productId = '660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440123';
const url = `https://api.tribemade.in/api/products/${productId}`;
const headers = {
    'X-API-Key': 'tb-a1b2-c3d-e4f5'
};

fetch(url, {
    method: 'DELETE',
    headers: headers
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
// Output: {"message": "Product deleted successfully"}
```

```php PHP
<?php
$product_id = '660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440123';
$url = "https://api.tribemade.in/api/products/{$product_id}";
$headers = array(
    'X-API-Key: tb-a1b2-c3d-e4f5'
);

$ch = curl_init($url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST, 'DELETE');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $response;
// Output: {"message": "Product deleted successfully"}
?>
```

</CodeGroup>

### Success Response

<CodeGroup>

```json 200 OK
{
  "message": "Product deleted successfully"
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Error Responses

### 404 Not Found

```json
{
  "error": "Product not found or does not belong to this store"
}
```

**Causes:**
- Product ID doesn't exist
- Product belongs to a different store
- Product was already deleted

**Fix:** Verify the product ID is correct and belongs to your store.

### 400 Bad Request - Has Active Orders

```json
{
  "error": "Cannot delete product with active orders in processing or dispatched status. Please wait for orders to complete or cancel them first."
}
```

**Cause:** Product has orders in active states (started, processing, or dispatched).

**Why:** Deleting products with active orders would break order fulfillment and customer experience.

**Solution Options:**

1. **Wait for orders to complete** - Orders will naturally progress to delivered status
2. **Cancel the orders** - Use [Update Order Status](/api-reference/orders/update-status) API to cancel orders
3. **Deactivate instead** - Use [Edit Product](/api-reference/products/edit) to set `is_active: false` to hide the product

<Tip>
  Consider deactivating products (`is_active: false`) instead of deleting if you want to preserve product history.
</Tip>

### 401 Unauthorized

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid API key"
}
```

or

```json
{
  "error": "Missing API key"
}
```

### 429 Too Many Requests

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "retry_after": 60
}
```

## Safe Deletion Workflow

### Step 1: Check for Active Orders

Before deleting, check if the product has active orders:

```python
import requests

def can_delete_product(product_id):
    """
    Check if a product can be safely deleted
    Returns: (can_delete: bool, reason: str)
    """
    # In a real implementation, you'd query your order database
    # or use a hypothetical "Get Product Orders" endpoint
    
    # For now, just attempt deletion and handle the error
    url = f"https://api.tribemade.in/api/products/{product_id}"
    headers = {"X-API-Key": "tb-a1b2-c3d-e4f5"}
    
    response = requests.delete(url, headers=headers)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return True, "Product deleted successfully"
    elif response.status_code == 400:
        error = response.json()['error']
        if 'active orders' in error:
            return False, "Has active orders"
    elif response.status_code == 404:
        return False, "Product not found"
    
    return False, "Unknown error"

# Usage
can_delete, reason = can_delete_product("660e8400-...")
print(f"Can delete: {can_delete}, Reason: {reason}")
```

### Step 2: Deactivate Instead

If deletion fails due to active orders, deactivate the product instead:

```python
import requests

def delete_or_deactivate_product(product_id):
    """
    Try to delete product, deactivate if deletion fails
    """
    base_url = "https://api.tribemade.in/api/products"
    headers = {
        "X-API-Key": "tb-a1b2-c3d-e4f5",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    
    # Try to delete
    delete_url = f"{base_url}/{product_id}"
    response = requests.delete(delete_url, headers=headers)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print(f"✓ Product {product_id} deleted successfully")
        return "deleted"
    
    elif response.status_code == 400:
        error = response.json()['error']
        if 'active orders' in error:
            # Deactivate instead
            edit_url = f"{base_url}/{product_id}/edit"
            data = {
                "is_active": False,
                "internal_note": "Marked for deletion - has active orders"
            }
            
            edit_response = requests.put(edit_url, headers=headers, json=data)
            if edit_response.status_code == 200:
                print(f"⚠ Product {product_id} has active orders - deactivated instead")
                return "deactivated"
    
    print(f"✗ Failed to delete or deactivate product {product_id}")
    return "failed"

# Usage
result = delete_or_deactivate_product("660e8400-...")
```

## Bulk Deletion

Delete multiple products with proper error handling:

```python
import requests
import time

def bulk_delete_products(product_ids):
    """
    Delete multiple products with safety checks
    
    Returns: {
        "deleted": [...],
        "deactivated": [...],
        "failed": [...]
    }
    """
    base_url = "https://api.tribemade.in/api/products"
    headers = {
        "X-API-Key": "tb-a1b2-c3d-e4f5",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    
    results = {
        "deleted": [],
        "deactivated": [],
        "failed": []
    }
    
    for i, product_id in enumerate(product_ids):
        # Try to delete
        delete_url = f"{base_url}/{product_id}"
        response = requests.delete(delete_url, headers=headers)
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            results["deleted"].append(product_id)
            print(f"✓ Deleted: {product_id}")
        
        elif response.status_code == 400:
            error = response.json()['error']
            if 'active orders' in error:
                # Deactivate instead
                edit_url = f"{base_url}/{product_id}/edit"
                data = {"is_active": False}
                
                edit_response = requests.put(edit_url, headers=headers, json=data)
                if edit_response.status_code == 200:
                    results["deactivated"].append(product_id)
                    print(f"⚠ Deactivated (has orders): {product_id}")
                else:
                    results["failed"].append(product_id)
                    print(f"✗ Failed: {product_id}")
        
        elif response.status_code == 404:
            print(f"⚠ Not found: {product_id}")
            results["failed"].append(product_id)
        
        else:
            results["failed"].append(product_id)
            print(f"✗ Error: {product_id}")
        
        # Respect rate limit (10 req/min for delete)
        # Process ~8 per minute to be safe
        if (i + 1) % 8 == 0 and i + 1 < len(product_ids):
            print("Waiting 60s for rate limit...")
            time.sleep(60)
        else:
            time.sleep(7)  # ~8-9 requests per minute
    
    return results

# Usage
product_ids = [
    "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440123",
    "770e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440124",
    "880e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440125"
]

results = bulk_delete_products(product_ids)
print(f"\nSummary:")
print(f"Deleted: {len(results['deleted'])}")
print(f"Deactivated: {len(results['deactivated'])}")
print(f"Failed: {len(results['failed'])}")
```

## Alternative: Deactivate Instead of Delete

In most cases, it's better to deactivate products rather than delete them:

### Why Deactivate?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="clock-rotate-left" title="Preserve History">
    - Maintains order references
    - Keeps sales data for analytics
    - Can be reactivated anytime
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="chart-line" title="Maintain Analytics">
    - Historical sales data remains intact
    - Revenue reports stay accurate
    - Customer order history preserved
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="rotate" title="Easy Reactivation">
    - Seasonal products can be easily reactivated
    - No need to recreate product data
    - Images and details remain intact
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="shield" title="Safer Operation">
    - No risk of accidentally deleting important products
    - Can't delete products with active orders
    - Reversible action
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### How to Deactivate

Use the [Edit Product](/api-reference/products/edit) API:

```python
import requests

def deactivate_product(product_id, reason=""):
    """
    Deactivate a product instead of deleting
    """
    url = f"https://api.tribemade.in/api/products/{product_id}/edit"
    headers = {
        "X-API-Key": "tb-a1b2-c3d-e4f5",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    
    data = {
        "is_active": False,
        "internal_note": f"Deactivated: {reason}" if reason else "Deactivated"
    }
    
    response = requests.put(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print(f"✓ Product {product_id} deactivated")
        return True
    else:
        print(f"✗ Failed to deactivate {product_id}")
        return False

# Usage
deactivate_product(
    "660e8400-...",
    reason="Out of stock, waiting for supplier"
)
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Consider deactivation first">
    Before deleting, ask yourself:
    - Will I need this product again? (seasonal items)
    - Does it have order history I want to preserve?
    - Am I just temporarily out of stock?
    
    If yes to any, use deactivation instead of deletion.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="gauge-low" title="Respect the lower rate limit">
    Delete endpoint is limited to **10 requests per minute** (vs 20 for other operations):
    - Process ~8 products per minute to be safe
    - Add delays between deletion requests
    - This is intentional for safety
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="shield-check" title="Always handle errors gracefully">
    Products with active orders can't be deleted:
    - Implement fallback to deactivation
    - Log products that couldn't be deleted
    - Retry later or manually handle edge cases
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="floppy-disk" title="Keep deletion logs">
    Track all deletion operations:
    - Product ID and name
    - Deletion timestamp
    - Success/failure status
    - Reason for deletion
    
    Useful for audit trails and debugging.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="triangle-exclamation" title="Deletion is permanent">
    Once deleted:
    - Product data cannot be recovered
    - Must recreate from scratch if needed
    - All product details, images, and metadata are lost
    
    Consider exporting product data before bulk deletions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## When to Actually Delete

Delete products when:

- ✅ Product was created by mistake
- ✅ Duplicate products that need cleanup
- ✅ Test products from development
- ✅ Products with no orders and never will be sold again
- ✅ Old products that have been replaced and all orders are completed

Don't delete when:

- ❌ Product is temporarily out of stock (deactivate instead)
- ❌ Seasonal products (deactivate and reactivate later)
- ❌ Products with active orders
- ❌ Products with valuable sales history
- ❌ You might want to resell similar products later
